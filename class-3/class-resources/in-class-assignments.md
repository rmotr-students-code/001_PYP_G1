# Account (abstract)
# SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount

# A SavingsAccount class, in addition to the attributes of an Account
# object, should have an interest variable and a
# method which adds interest to the account.

# A CurrentAccount class,
# in addition to the attributes of an Account object,
# should have an overdraft limit variable. Ensure that you have overridden
# methods of the Account class as necessary in both derived classes.
