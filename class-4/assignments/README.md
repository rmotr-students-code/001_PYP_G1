### Github repos

Using the github3.py library, write a program that asks for a user's
login and password and return the most starred repo for that user.
The library is already installed in the system.
Here you can find the docs: http://github3py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

### OO Roulette

Using Object Oriented design, build a Roulette simulator. The user
starts with some default amount of money and should be
able to place a bet in any number. The Rulette should
simulate the play. Either the user wins or loses, the program should
keep track of the money of the user. The game ends when the user loses all
his/her money.
